Hello, my name is Kevin. I live in San Francisco, California. 

I am employed as a research analyst with an economic consulting firm. 

With inspiration from Hadley Wickham and Edward Tufte, I specialize in data exploration and data visualization using R and SQL.

My current learning projects are appropriately handling out-of-memory data for statistical modeling. Outside of work, I follow machine learning news and try to apply those skills to side projects with Python.

I studied a combination of Mathematics, Computer Science, Statistics, and Economics at the University of Pennsylvania, and I am always looking to keep learning. 

I also enjoy music ([soundcloud][soundcloud] and [lastfm][lastfm]) and [photography][flickr].

This site you are at is my [home site][homesite] where I will add things that interest me. 

My goal is to jot down my thoughts and experiences. These will be the pages to my life story. 

### Contact me

Find me on [LinkedIn][linkedin] / [Github][github] or just say `Hello` at 
[kevinrpan@gmail.com](kevinrpan+git@gmail.com).

This blog is created with [Jekyll][jekyll] and Github Pages.
